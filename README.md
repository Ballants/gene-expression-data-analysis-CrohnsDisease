# Gene expression data analysis in Crohn's Disease

Final project for the **Bioinformatics** course held by prof. Giulia Fiscon at **La Sapienza University of Rome** in A.Y. 2022/2023.

## Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to identify genes that exhibit differential expression in patients affected by Crohn's Disease compared to healthy individuals.
By doing so, it is possible to discern patterns of gene activity associated with the disease.
This analysis aims to uncover potential biomarkers, pathways, or molecular mechanisms underlying the development, progression, and response to treatment of Crohn's Disease. Such insights can lead to a better understanding of the disease's molecular basis and may contribute to the development of more effective diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies.
